POWER CALCULATOR
when the  user enters the site they will only see "POWER CALCULATOR" and field to enable them to enter numbers of device they have
after selecting the number of devices the user will see four fields pop up below align horizontally
the four field align horizontally will be representing one device
then field one and two for entering amps and volt respectively incase the user device does'nt show watt
box three and four is for entering watt and time respectivelly assuming the user knows the devices watt
if the user enters amps and voltage, the field will be automatically filled because the program will calculate the value for watt by multiplying amps by volt
if the user fills the watt field, the amps and volt fill will be automatically greyed out because this field will no longer be needed for that device
the time field will be able to accept both decimal and fractional values
once the user has filled out all the availabe field, the program will have a compute botton that enables the program to calculate the result
the result will be calculated by first finding the unit for one device by multiplying watt by time then adding all the devices adding the result of all the devices calculated by this method
after this the final result will be displayed
